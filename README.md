## Project Description
The battleship game is a classic strategy game, the rules of the game are as follows. The game is played with a 10-by-10 square board. A player has five ships, which occupies a certain number of squares on the board: a destroyer (2 squares), a submarine (3 squares), a 
cruiser (3 squares), a battleship (4 squares), and an aircraft carrier (5 squares). Each 
ship  is  placed  either  horizontally  or  vertically, A result of every shot is displayed as either a hit or a miss. The goal is to 
sink  all  the  opponentâ€™s  ships . (To 
sink a ship, all squares occupied by the ship must be hit.)
